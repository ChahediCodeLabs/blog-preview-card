## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive design
- Hover states

### What I learned

I learned how to change the type of the cursor and how to define an image as the cursor when it hovers over a title, also how to do really beautiful responsive design that integrate the footer with the main content by removing the body's background-color and the main's border, finally; I learned an essential way for a web developer; it's to use a Figma file and extract the CSS styles because this challenge are Free+, It was an amazing experience !

Excerpts that I am proud of:

```css
main .content h1:hover {
  color: #f4d04e;
  cursor: url('assets/images/pointer.png'), pointer;
}
```
```css
@media (max-width: 350) {
  body{
    background-color: white;
  }
  main {
    border: none;
    box-shadow: none;
  }
}
```
